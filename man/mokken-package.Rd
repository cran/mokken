\title{
Mokken Scale Analysis
}
\description{
Mokken scale analysis (Mokken, 1971; Sijtsma & Molenaar, 2002; Sijtsma & Van der Ark, 2017) is a scaling procedure 
for both dichotomous and polytomous items.
It consists of an item selection algorithm to partition a set of items into Mokken scales
 and several methods to check the assumptions of two nonparametric item response theory
models: the monotone homogeneity model and the double monotonicity model.
The output of this R-package resembles the output of the stand-alone program MSP (Molenaar & Sijtsma, 2000).

A guide for Mokken scale analysis in R for people who do not know R (Van der Ark, 2010)  is available as a vignette from \url{https://sites.google.com/a/tilburguniversity.edu/avdrark/mokken}.
The Mokken package was created by Andries van der Ark, who is also the maintainer. Significant parts have been developed by Letty Koopman (multilevel analysis) and Don van den Berg and Hendrik Straat (all C and C++ codes).
